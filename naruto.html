    <h1>TALE OF UZUMAKI NARUTO</h1>
    <img class="index-img" src="/CODE/html/R (1).jfif" align="center" />
    <p><mark>Naruto is one of my favourite anime charater,</mark><br><br>Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams
        of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts – the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto
        an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997). Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in tankōbon (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga
        was adapted into an anime television series produced by Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English dub of the series aired on Cartoon Network and YTV from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel
        to the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes. <br>The English dub was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011, airing the first 98 episodes, and then switched over to Adult Swim's Toonami programming
        block in January 2014, starting over from the first episode. The English dub is still airing weekly on Adult Swim to this day. Viz Media began streaming the anime series on their streaming service Neon Alley in December 2012 on 99 episodes, and
        ended in March 2016, after 338 episodes. Besides the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven movies and twelve original video animations (OVAs). <br>Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed
        by several companies. Viz Media licensed the manga and anime for North American production and serialized Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The anime series began airing in the United States and Canada in 2005, and in the United
        Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The films and most OVAs from the series were also released by Viz, with the first film premiering in movie theaters. <br>The story of Naruto continues with Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, in
        Boruto: Naruto Next Generations: Boruto wishes to create his own ninja way instead of following his father's. Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series in history having 250 million copies in circulation worldwide in 47 countries and regions,
        with 153 million copies in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller
        list several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's character development, strong storylines, and well-executed fight scenes, though some felt the fight scenes slowed the story down. Critics noted
        that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism </p>

        <h3>TEAM 7(Kakashi)</h3>
        <img class="img-2" src="/CODE/html/Team_Kakashi.jfif" />
        <p>Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura are organised into a team following their graduation from the Academy in order to balance out their talents: Naruto, the worst student in his class, would benefit from Sakura's intelligence and Sasuke's proficiency with
            ninjutsu; Sakura would benefit from her more battle-capable teammates; Sasuke would benefit from being forced to work with others. Kakashi is selected to lead them in order to keep an eye on Naruto, Nine-Tails' jinchūriki and, in the anime,
            to help Sasuke cope with life after the Uchiha Clan Downfall, and as well to develop his Sharingan. As with all the previous genin teams he was put in charge of, Kakashi gives them a bell test in order to determine if they give the proper
            importance to teamwork. Unlike all previous genin teams, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura pass the test.

            <mark>this are some of the cool jutsu Naruto learned</mark>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>shadow clone jutsu</li>
            <p><b>The Shadow Clone Technique is a clone technique created by Tobirama Senju</b> This jutsu allows the user to create one or more copies of themselves. The user's chakra is evenly divided between themselves and their clones: creating one clone
                will give it half the user's chakra, creating two clones will give each a third of the user's chakra, and so on. Depending on how much chakra the user has and how many clones they make, this rapid depletion of their reserves can be dangerous.
                Because of this, usually only those of at least jōnin-level can safely use the standard Shadow Clone Technique.[</p>

            <li>
                Rasengan
                <p>The Rasengan is a spinning ball of chakra formed and held in the palm of the user's hand, which is only known to a handful of shinobi.</p>
                <p>The Rasengan was created by Minato Namikaze, which he based on the Tailed Beast Ball.[2] He spent three years creating the Rasengan,[3] which he intended to be the highest form of shape transformation. Because it represents the high form
                    of shape transformation, mastering the Rasengan also grants the user a great deal of mastery over shape transformation, even if they are unaware of the concept of shape transformation.[4] Like many of Minato's jutsu, the Rasengan does
                    not require hand seals to perform. Once it is formed, it also does not require any additional chakra to sustain it, which means that there is no definite limit to how long the Rasengan can be maintained. However, the Rasengan will
                    dissipate if it collides with something, even if it's an unintended target. Though the Rasengan's shape is consistent from user to user, its size varies from only barely large enough to be noticeable to much larger than the user's
                    hand. Greater experience with the Rasengan allows the user to create them in a larger size, and even one in each hand.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><u>rasen shuriken</u></li>
                <p>
                    The Rasenshuriken was invented by Naruto Uzumaki shortly after he figured out the principles of the Wind Release: Rasengan. Like that technique, Naruto typically has the help of two shadow clones in the Rasenshuriken's formation: he provides the chakra,
                    one clone helps keep the chakra contained, and the second clone adds his wind nature. It is the completed version of the Wind Release: Rasengan, with four large points around the central Rasengan core, giving the appearance of a fūma
                    shuriken. It also gives off a loud screeching noise.[3] By the time of The Last: Naruto the Movie, Naruto is able to create Rasenshuriken without aid and is able to remotely guide it.

            </ul>
            <li><u>tail beast state</u></li>
            <p>All jinchūriki are able to use certain abilities granted to them by their tailed beasts. As they get older and they gain (or lose, as the case may be) control over their tailed beast's power, they are also able to transform into their tailed
                beast to varying degrees, granting them capabilities increasingly closer to the tailed beast itself.<br>The Nine-Tails Chakra Mode and its related forms coat the user's body in yellow chakra, which emanates from them reminiscent of flickering
                flames;[4][5] in the anime, Minato Namikaze's is also surrounded by a slight dark aura.[6] The form's design differs between users and can even change over time,[1] but certain features are consistent across all forms: two horns on their
                head, six magatama markings around their neck, some sort of prominent circular/swirl design over their stomach, and various other lines extending along their body.</p>
            <img src="/CODE/html/R.png" width="30%" height="30%" />
            <li><u>sage mode</u> </li>
            <p>Sage Mode is an empowered state that can be entered by blending natural energy with one's chakra, creating senjutsu chakra. Sage Mode allows users to tap into the natural force of the world, opening up new techniques to them and allowing them
                to power up existing ones with the new senjutsu chakra.<br>Sage Mode is known to be taught in two places: at Mount Myōboku by the toads and at Ryūchi Cave by the snakes. Users of Sage Mode must possess "extreme chakra levels" to invoke
                senjutsu.[2] It is also important that their bodies be strong enough to support the increased power. Orochimaru, who discovered the Ryūchi Cave and gained the ability to mould Senjutsu chakra, was not able to use Sage Transformation to
                enter Sage Mode for this reason.[3] In order to enter Sage Mode, the gatherer must remain absolutely still in order to be one with nature and balance the natural energy with their own physical and spiritual energies.</p>
